            <h2>Difference between javascript and nodejs.</h2>

            <h2>When should you use nodejs and when should you use mongodb ?</h2>
            <p>NoSQL databases like MongoDB are a good choice when your data is document-centric and doesn't fit well into the schema of a relational database, when you need to accommodate massive scale, when you are rapidly prototyping, and a few other use cases.Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.</p>

            <h2>What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work</h2>
            <p>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.</p>
